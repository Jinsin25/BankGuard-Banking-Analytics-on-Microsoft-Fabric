# BankGuard-Banking-Analytics-on-Microsoft-Fabric

## 🎯 What This Project Does

BankGuard is a banking analytics solution built on **Microsoft Fabric** that answers three questions every bank cares about:

1. 📊 **How are customers spending?** — Transaction trends, channel usage, top merchant categories
2. 💳 **Which loans are at risk?** — NPA tracking, overdue loans, customer risk segmentation
3. 🔍 **Who might default next?** — Simple rule-based credit risk scoring (beginner ML)

## 📊 What Each Notebook Does

### Notebook 1 — Load Bronze
- Reads CSV files from the Lakehouse Files section
- Adds ingestion metadata (load date, source)
- Saves as Delta tables — no transformation yet

### Notebook 2 — Transform Silver
- Fixes data types (dates, decimals)
- Removes duplicate records
- Adds useful derived columns (age, transaction hour, NPA classification)
- Masks PII columns (email, phone)

### Notebook 3 — Build Gold
- Aggregates data for Power BI
- Creates `customer_summary`, `monthly_transactions`, `loan_portfolio_summary`
- These are the tables Power BI connects to

### Notebook 4 — Credit Risk Scoring
- Beginner-level: rule-based scoring (no complex ML libraries)
- Scores each customer 0–100 based on simple rules
- Saves scores to Gold for the dashboard

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | What You Learn |
|---|---|
| Fabric Lakehouse | How OneLake stores Delta tables |
| PySpark Notebooks | Data transformation at scale |
| Delta Lake | ACID transactions, time travel |
| Fabric Warehouse (SQL) | Querying data with SQL |
| Power BI in Fabric | Building dashboards on top of Lakehouse |

---

## 📈 Sample Dashboard Pages (Power BI)

1. **Executive Overview** — Total transactions, total loan book, NPA ratio
2. **Transaction Analysis** — Spend by channel, by category, by month
3. **Loan Portfolio** — NPA breakdown, DPD distribution, loan type mix
4. **Customer Risk Map** — Risk segment distribution, high-risk customer list

---

## ⚙️ Setup (Step by Step)


**Quick start:**
1. Create a Fabric workspace (free trial works)
2. Create a Lakehouse named `bankguard`
3. Upload the 3 CSV files from `data_samples/`
4. Run the 4 notebooks in order
5. Connect Power BI to the Gold Lakehouse
